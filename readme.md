## Description

The Website Analyzer is a sophisticated web application designed to provide in-depth Customer Experience (CX) evaluations for websites. Leveraging the power of Next.js for the frontend and the Google AI API (specifically the Gemini Pro model) for analysis, this tool offers valuable insights into various aspects of web design and user experience.

Our analyzer goes beyond surface-level metrics, diving deep into six crucial aspects of website design and functionality:

1. Visual Appeal & Branding
2. User Journey
3. Intuitive Navigation
4. Visual Hierarchy
5. Value Proposition
6. Call to Action

For each of these aspects, the analyzer provides a comprehensive breakdown including a numerical score, detailed rationale, specific strengths, and areas for improvement. This holistic approach ensures that website owners and developers receive actionable insights to enhance their online presence.
